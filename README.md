# Hello!

This is the repository for my résumé. If you're looking for my résumé, [here's the pdf version](https://github.com/johncch/resume/blob/master/output/resume.pdf)

After wrangling the résumé in InDesign for many years, I've decided to store my résumé in markdown and convert into different formats as needed. If you're recruiting and asking me for a specific format of my résumé, then this is where the magic happens.

No reason why you might, but if you are, this repo is MIT Licensed.
